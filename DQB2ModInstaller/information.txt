LINKDATA PATCHER TOOL.

This program will patch modded content into your game.

RECOMENDATIONS:
- BACKUP THE FILES!!! You cannot reverse this, so to go back to the unmodded game you will need to restore your backup.
- Use the LINKDATA_PATCH.bin instead of modifying the original LINKDATA.bin directly. This file contains the game updates instead of the core game.
- It is not reccomended to patch multiple mods at once. If you want multiple mods, either ask the creators to make a combined patch, or play them separately.

USAGE:
- Select the LINKDATA.bin or LINKDATA_PATCH.bin file when prompted. You can find this in the DQB2 steam page Options->Manage->Browse Local Files
- Select the mod file you want to patch in when prompted. This is a .dqb2.bin file.
- THE PROGRAM DOES NOT CHECK TO SEE IF THE FILE IS VALID. Do not be dumb. You can corrupt your LINKDATA (HAVE A BACKUP ALWAYS)

If the error "Mod not compatible" appears it means this package does not contain the information for your version.

ALL VERSIONS OF DQB2 ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS TOOL, BUT MODS MAY NOT BE. 
Mods have a set number of versions they support, chosen by the modder. Ask them if you have this error, alongside your version.
